    <h2>Welcome To Austin, Texas</h2>
    <p>This has been my home for almost my whole life. I have moved around a lot in my life, and by far Austin has been the one city I have been proud and honored to call my true home. I met my wife here, had my son, and grew up in this wonderful city.</p>
    <p>You might ask, "What does this have to do with coding or web development?". Well the answer is I started learning html and basic web design in high school. I didn't know really know if I would enjoy it or if I would be any good, but none the less it was a class that would take me through my high school career. Jump forward 7 years and I was working in healthcare and my co-worker had introduced me to code academy and stated that he had so much and was having a lot of fun.</p>
    <p>I started learning again, and was a breathe of fresh air, exactly what I needed again. I picked up where I left off with html and css, and started learning other languages like python, javascript, and ruby, but I knew that if I was going to take it seriously I would have to work really hard at it and dedicate my extra time to studying and reading.</p>
    <h3>"That was when my life changed"</h3>
    <p>I found out I was having a child. My son, I knew my entire world was going to flip upside down and I had no idea what I was doing, or where I was going career wise, and I was completely stressed out. That was when my life changed. I knew I had to get my shit together and be the best father I could and stop thinking linearly but do something I really enjoyed. Ultimately, I knew I needed to find a better job and start doing what I really want to do.</p>
	<p>I started researching online schools, local community colleges, and boot camps all over the U.S, and ultimately my desicion came down to one thing. Where can I learn from the best teachers and immerse myself in the culture and soak everything up in order to get to my goal, in order to catapult my success in what would ultimately be my new career. So I landed on General Assembly. I researched a lot... I mean a lot and found that this would be the best fit for my learning needs and look forward to learning and doing what I am passionate about.</p>
